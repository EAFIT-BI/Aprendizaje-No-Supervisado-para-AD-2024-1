SpaceX closed the month of March with this achievement, which underscores SpaceX’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of space exploration.  SpaceX has been on a trajectory of remarkable growth, surpassing its own records year after year. In 2020 it launched 26 missions, 31 in 2021, and doubled that with 61 missions in 2022. By 2023, the company delivered approximately 80% of all Earth payload mass to orbit with 96 missions completed, outpacing competitors like China and other global players.  The pace of SpaceX’s launches has been accelerating steadily, with the company averaging one launch every four days throughout 2023. This rapid cadence reflects SpaceX’s dedication to innovation & efficiency in space travel.  SpaceX has already completed 32 missions in 2024. The recent accomplishment in March, where SpaceX completed 12 Falcon 9 missions in a single month, demonstrates the company’s ability to meet & exceed its ambitious goals with a launch rate of one every 2.8 days. “Falcon 9 successfully launched our 11th and 12th missions of the month from Florida earlier today,” announced the company on March 31. The missions deployed Eutelsat 36D satellite into a geosynchronous transfer orbit from NASA Kennedy Space Center’s Launch Pad-39A. And approximately “3.5 hours later, Falcon 9 launched 23 Starlink satellites to low-Earth orbit from pad 40, completing our 260th reflight of an orbital class rocket on the seven-year anniversary of first achieving this feat,” shared the company.  Key to SpaceX’s success is the reusability of its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, which enables the company to significantly increase its launch pace while reducing costs. SpaceX has reused multiple boosters in its Falcon 9 fleet 19 times, & engineers are working to qualify Falcon 9 for up to 40 reflights each.  As of now, SpaceX has performed a total of 327 missions, landed orbital-class rockets 291 times, and reused previously-flown Falcon 9 boosters in its fleet 261 times. With each milestone achieved, SpaceX reaffirms its position at the forefront of space exploration, inspiring admiration for its groundbreaking achievements. As the company continues to push boundaries and reach new heights, the future of space exploration looks brighter than ever before.  ─── ･ ｡ﾟ☆: *.☽ .* :☆ﾟ. ───  Author @JaneidyEve  Read more at Cosmic Chronicles: https://cosmicchroniclesnews.com/2024/04/02/spacex-achieves-ambitious-goal-12-falcon-9-missions-in-a-single-month/   Thanks for reading!
